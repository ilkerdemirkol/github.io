      <p><strong>Ilker Demirkol</strong> is currently working as Associate Prof. in the Dept. of Mining, Industrial and ICT Engineering at Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.
Demirkol received his B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Engineering from the Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey. 
Over the years, he has worked in a number of research laboratories and corporations, where he has held several positions as Network Engineer, System and Database consultant, or Lecturer. 
</p>

On top of his 11 years of industrial experience, Dr. Demirkol has an extensive research
experience through the 20+ research projects he has participated at institutions in Europe
and USA. The total budget of these projects amount to more than 25M€, while he has been
the scientific coordinator in three of the European projects (2 H2020 and 1 FP7 projects)
and project coordinator in one European project. The quality of his research has been
acknowledged through his 30+ papers published in Q1-indexed journals and ~50
peer-reviewed international conference publications. He has generated
intellectual property through 1 granted and 3 filed patents.</p>
      
<p>
